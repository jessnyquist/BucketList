# BucketList
some final touches:
-add encouraging notes when create event/list/etc.


we need to decide how to do lists:
should we have three different list pages:
1. for your own lists, can add to, check off as completed, etc.
2. one for public lists WHEN LOGGED IN, can add to your own lists, would pass in currentAuth and have a dropdown with your lists as options to add to, you cannot check off as completed on this page, no check boxes
3. one for public lists when you're not logged in with just the ability to see

a lot of the code is copy paste with some differences
